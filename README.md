# Playing pyplot for stock data
As a placeholder for me to play financial data, pandas, and python plots


### Brief Introduction

1. Read quote of two stocks from **Google Finance** to *pandas.DataFrame*
2. Draw their trending by *matplotlib.pyplot* for comparison.
3. Plot vertical lines to indicate events, and highlight the highest and lowest prices. 

### Example

![Stock comparison](/stock_comparison.png?raw=true "IBM v.s. Google over the past year")

### Script 2

Draw heatmap via **seaborn** to get a sense of my hyper-parameter tuning on XGBoost model

### Result

![XGBoost hyperparmeter tuning ](/hp_tuning_heatmap.png?raw=true "")
