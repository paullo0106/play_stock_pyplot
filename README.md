# Playing pyplot for stock data
As a placeholder for me to play financial data, pandas, and python plots


### Brief Introduction

1. Read quote of two stocks from **Google Finance** to *pandas.DataFrame*
2. Draw their trending by *matplotlib.pyplot* for comparison.
3. Plot vertical lines to indicate events, and highlight the highest and lowest prices. 

### Example
